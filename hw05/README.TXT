***This is my shell. My shell has LIMITED functionality which I'll describe below:***

When running my shell, my shell can read at most two commands per line. (In other words, my shell can only execute ONE operator per line.)
My shell supports seven operators:
	<
	>
	|
	;
	||
	&&
	&

Because I am using strtok() to parse your input, operators must begin and end with a space.
	(e.g 'echo hi ; echo bye' is a valid command but 'echo hi; echo bye' won't work the way semicolon works)

Other than that.... Have fun!
